# 1. SteamDB-RecSys This project aims to be an educational project to build
This is a personal project to design, build, and deploy an offline recommendation system from scratch using game review data from Steam, hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedtarek01234/steam-games-reviews-and-rankings/data) | HuggingFace  mirror.

The project was created on 04/10/2024, by a graduating undergraduate student looking to learn more about data engineering, distributed system, and recommendation system.

The details of building the system, as well as the knowledge learnt about industry best practices will be provided in my blog at https://hung.bearblog.dev/. The particular posts are listed below.
